# CENSO - Commandline and Python Package for Conformer-Rotamer Ensembles

![CENSO Logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e6bac6a-2637-4207-8eca-3122ab90112a)

**CENSO** is a Python package designed to automate the refinement of **Conformer-Rotamer Ensembles** at the **DFT level**. It supports both **command-line usage** and usage via a fully implemented **Python API**. CENSO enables calculations of ensemble properties like **NMR parameters**, **optical rotation**, and **UV-Vis spectra**.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Prescreening, Screening, Optimization, and Refinement** of conformer-rotamer ensembles.
  - **Geometry Optimization** using:
    - ORCA (native optimizer)
    - xtb (ANCOPT)
  - **Thermal contributions** using xtb single-point Hessians (`--bhess`)
- **Solvent Models**:
  - ORCA: **CPCM**, **SMD**
  - Turbomole: **COSMO**, **DCOSMORS**, **COSMORS**
  - xtb: **ALPB**, **GBSA**
- **Property Calculations**:
  - **NMR**: ORCA, Turbomole
  - **Optical Rotation**: Turbomole
  - **UV/Vis**: ORCA
- **Agnostic to global optimizer**, input files just need to be in xyz-format
- CLI and Python API

## **Update: CENSO 3.0**
Version **3.0** introduces significant architectural improvements, particularly enhancing its usability as a **Python package**. Overall usage is also improved, e.g.:
- automatic system path exploration (finding program binaries, program versions, etc.),
- automatic system recognition,
- improved clarity for printout,
- improved logging,
- more configuration options for command-line interface.

Configuration is now managed using **Pydantic V2**, and several keywords have been updated. Refer to `example.censo2rc` for details.

Resources and tasks are now managed using Dask. This is in preparation of a multi-node implementation.

New auxiliary command-line scripts (`nmrplot`, `uvvisplot`, `c2anmr`) have been added for improved workflow support.
`nmrplot` and `uvvisplot` are utilities for immediate visualization of NMR and UV/Vis data, respectively.
`c2anmr` is a tool to ensure backwards compatibility with ANMR, due to the new directory structure since CENSO 2.0.

The documentation has also been updated to reflect the new version and includes more guidance on usage.
It now also includes an example for the calculation of the NMR spectrum of glycerol.

## **Installation**

### **Using `pip`**
```bash
pip install .
```
To install additional command-line scripts and dependencies:
```bash
pip install .[scripts]
```

### **Manual Installation**
1. Add `CENSO/src` to your `$PYTHONPATH`.
2. Add `CENSO` to your `$PATH`.

---

## **Usage**

### **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**
After installation, use the `censo` command. For help, run:
```bash
censo -h
```

> **Note**: Opposed to previous versions, default values are now assumed for `-i` (`crest_conformers.xyz`) and `--maxcores` (total CPU cores).

In the CLI version, CENSO will try to automatically detect binary locations for necessary programs, as well as versions. If you want override, use the `[paths]` section in your `.censo2rc` file.
Furthermore, it will try to automatically detect the number of available CPU cores. To override these settings, as well as general settings, you can use the command-line arguments.

  --new-config          Write new configuration file, which is placed into the current directory.
  --inprc INPRCPATH     Use to provide a path to the CENSO configuration file if you want to use a different one than the default (~/.censo2rc).

                        Path to a file containing constraints in xtb format for use in geometry optimizations.
  --maxcores MAXCORES   Number of cores that should be used for CENSO on the machine. If this is not provided CENSO will use the maximum number available (also checks for slurm
                        environment variables).

### **Python API Usage**
CENSO can be integrated into Python scripts for custom workflows. Below is a basic setup example:

```python
from censo.ensembledata import EnsembleData
from censo.configuration import configure
from censo.ensembleopt import prescreening, screening, optimization
from censo.properties import nmr
from censo.config import GeneralConfig
from censo.parallel import get_cluster

# CENSO outputs files in the current working directory (os.getcwd())
input_path = "rel/path/to/your/inputfile"  # Relative to working directory
ensemble = EnsembleData(input_file=input_path)

# For charged/open-shell systems:
# ensemble = EnsembleData()
# ensemble.read_input(input_path, charge=-1, unpaired=1)

# Load a custom rcfile (optional)
config = configure(rcpath="/path/to/rcfile")

# Configure dask client
cluster = get_cluster()
client = cluster.get_client()

# Ensure valid configuration
config.general.solvent = "dmso"
config = config.model_validate(config)

# Execute workflow steps
timings = [
    part(ensemble, config, client)
    for part in [prescreening, screening, optimization, nmr]
]
```

> **Note**: Results are stored in `<part>.json` files. For multiple runs, rename or move output folders to avoid overwriting.
